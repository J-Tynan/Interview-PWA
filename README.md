# Interview PWA

Lightweight, local-first interview prep dashboard using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- Data lives in `src/data/questions.json`.
- Notes are stored in IndexedDB with a localStorage fallback.
- Swap in a UI kit by replacing the component styles in `src/components` and `src/styles/base.css`.
